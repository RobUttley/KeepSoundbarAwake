## KeepSoundbarAwake

todo:  

- Work from command line options (period, sound file, active hours)
- Can we make it work on Mac/Linux too?  
- Can we embed the default sound into the exe?   
- Can we make a standalone monolithic exe?  
- Vet the duration of a user-supplied file (don't exceed 3s because of synchronous play call)
